# WIP
All of this is work in progress.
I have no idea how it will turn out if at all.
I just want to learn and experiment.
## Dependencies
- GLEW
- GLFW or SDL2
- libconfig
- xxd (at build time)
## Building
`$ make`
or if you want to use the SDL2 backend:
`$ make WIP_WINDOW_BACKEND=SDL2`

Note that the SDL2 backend is behind GLFW and may not work correctly.
